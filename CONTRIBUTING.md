# Contributing to LocalGrowth Project


## General 

 If you want to help with the code, first I would suggest you to setup the webapp as described in the README.
 


 A list of things we are working with is at our [trello page][1].

## As a developer 
  
  A big help would be helping with the testing framework. I know it is a crime that I havent done it already...

  Also as I am stil an amauteur I believe there is a lot of smelly things going on around here.


## As a designer
 
 You can find the related files and modify them to your liking

 *  HTML "app/views"
 *  CSS & JavaScript "app/assets"
